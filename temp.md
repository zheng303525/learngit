## OneMark

Hello, let's explore how to write markdown in OneNote.

- List, **bold**, __underline__, ==highlight==, `code`, etc
- As you can see, it renders in live preview with every `enter` key.
- How about a code block:
```js
var message = "hello"
console.log(message)


//hit ctrl + enter to exit block edit
```
Want some LaTex math? Sure.

E=mc^2

:) Remember, mardown source is preserved hiddendly in the line. So you can sitch it back as you want.
You can also edit the text directly in place, because markdown source will be changed correspondingly.
